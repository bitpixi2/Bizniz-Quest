Bizniz Quest is open to Reddit users aged 18 and older.

Void where prohibited by law.

Bizniz Quest is an independent community project and is not officially affiliated with Reddit Inc.

Participation in Bizniz Quest does not create any partnership, sponsorship, or endorsement by Reddit Inc., unless explicitly stated.

If a successful match occurs (as determined by the moderators), participants may be eligible to receive free swag (e.g., stickers, mugs).

Items are shipped only where legally and practically allowed.

Posts and replies in Bizniz Quest are public and may be viewed by anyone.

By posting, you grant Bizniz Quest, Hackeroos Pty Ltd, and Reddit the right to display, share, and moderate your content as needed.

You may delete your post at any time. Deletion removes it from public view but may persist in Reddit’s backups per their policies.


### 7. Success Stories

If you agree to share your success story with u/bitpixi in exchange for swag, you also agree that your story may be posted publicly on r/BiznizQuest (https://www.reddit.com/r/BiznizQuest).

### 8. No Guarantees

We do not guarantee matches, responses, or outcomes.

Swag availability is limited and not guaranteed for all participants.

To the fullest extent permitted by law, the moderators, Hackeroos Pty Ltd, and u/bitpixi are not liable for damages arising from participation.


### 10. Ownership & Future Transfer

Bizniz Quest was created by u/bitpixi, and all intellectual property is owned by Hackeroos Pty Ltd.

Hackeroos Pty Ltd reserves the right to license, transfer, or sell the game (including its brand, rules, and content framework) to Reddit or other parties.

If such a transfer occurs, users will be notified via an announcement on r/BiznizQuest (https://www.reddit.com/r/BiznizQuest), and the new owner’s terms may apply going forward.


### 11. Trademarks

Last updated: September 2025

Bizniz Quest values transparency. This Privacy Policy explains how information is handled when you participate in r/BiznizQuest (https://www.reddit.com/r/BiznizQuest).


### 1. Use of Reddit

Bizniz Quest is entirely hosted on Reddit.

Your activity is governed by Reddit’s Privacy Policy (https://www.redditinc.com/policies/privacy-policy).


### 2. Public Information You Provide

When you make a post or comment, it is publicly visible.

Information shared may include usernames, text, links, and other content you voluntarily provide.

Posts are not tied to any separate Bizniz Quest app session.


### 3. Success Stories

These records are minimal and not shared publicly, except as needed to run the game.


### 5. Swag Distribution

If you are selected to receive swag, you may be asked for a shipping address.

This information is collected privately (via Reddit DM or form) and used only to send your item.

Once shipped, the information is deleted and not stored long-term.


### 6. Deletion & Control

You may delete your Reddit posts and comments at any time.

Deleted content is removed from public view, but may remain in Reddit’s systems per their policy (see Reddit’s Privacy Policy: https://www.redditinc.com/policies/privacy-policy).
